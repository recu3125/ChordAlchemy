combine notes to make chords, and combine chords to make larger chords!

## Future possibilities
While this is currently just a small toy project, it could grow to include features such as:
- Merging the seven solfège syllables (do–re–mi–fa–sol–la–ti–do) into a single “C major scale” element.
- Drawing an arrow from a “C major scale” element to F to represent the IV scale degree.
- Drawing an arrow from V to I to represent dominant-to-tonic motion.
- Showing helpful tooltips on hover so learners can quickly read short explanations as they explore.
